Internship Projects in Web Development 
Task->1: TO-DO LIST
Create a To-Do List WebApp using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or any framework you know. The To-Do List should include features to add tasks, mark tasks as complete, and delete tasks.

Outcomes:
I have created a TO-DO-LIST WebApp using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It has a clean and user-friendly interface to interact with the To-Do List application. The input field and buttons are intuitive and accessible. Users can add new tasks to their to-do list. Tasks can be marked as completed, changing their appearance (e.g., strikethrough text). Tasks can be deleted from the list. The application provides immediate visual feedback when tasks are added, completed, or deleted.
